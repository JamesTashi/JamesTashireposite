More items will be added from time to time. I need to earn at least three qualified sales within 180 days so my account doesn't 
get terminated. 6 months from now. You might need to copy and paste links to your URL bar while I work on my website more.

Any suggestions on a new product? Contact me to promote them here!
Reasons for this: which will help me improve some stand points, my website, lunch programs and more improvements to some of my work, thank you!
