<h1>What's happening all, sorry I've been recently on the urge of doing my
work as a programmer and I work as a part-time customer service agent, 
I am experienced in video editing, website design, and a variety of computing and IT subjects so 
I couldn't keep track of what's going on, including situations regarding
COVID-19! 

&nbsp

Effective immediately, I made a short GITHUB redirect page where it will
take you to my Drive Repo, note that the Blakemen himself 
still has my new files.
No, my .edu account is not erased so it's a sigh of relief! 
I am working while my .edu account and business email is still intact.

&nbsp

In the meanwhile more Jeopardy videos are being posted to my Drive
as soon as I hold them. My capture card is slowing down my computer performance
so I can't record my own VHS tapes from the VCR as well.I have those ancient cables
Red, Yellow and While ones, they can't plug into my TV I own, just HDMI. I do have that converted.
That situation will be resolved if I have free time,

In the meanwhile, here is my GitHub page:

  Have a safe and warm day/night. God bless.</h1>
